- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MarkEScheidker
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science, engineering, programming, machine learning, and hardware design.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying at UAH, and I'm constantly trying to build and improve my skills through personal projects and coding exercises.
- ğŸ“« If for some reason you actually want to contact me, my student email is mes0057@uah.edu, but I probably won't respond quickly.
